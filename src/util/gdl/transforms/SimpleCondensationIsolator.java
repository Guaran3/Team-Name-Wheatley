			/* We now take the following approach to finding a useful condensation: 
			 * We start with a single candidate variable not found in the head.
			 * We add all the literals with that variable.
			 * Whenever we add a literal, we add all the non-head vars in that literal;
			 * whenever we add a variable, we add all the literals containing it.
			 * We stop when there's nothing left to add.
			 * If we end up with the entire set of literals, there's no condensation;
			 * otherwise, we generate a condensation of those vars and literals.
			 * Am I missing any cases?
			 * Yes, plenty
			 * What if we just gathered all the literals associated with the
			 * first variable, then used all the variables that only appear
			 * in those 
			 * That would have problems with examples like
			 * (<= (r1 x)
			 *     (r2 x a b)
			 *     (r3 x a c)
			 *     (not (r4 x b c)))
			 * In this case, we need both r2 and r3 if we're to factor out r4
			 * We could, however, factor out r2 and r3 to get:
			 * (<= (r5 x b c)
			 *     (r2 x a b)
			 *     (r3 x a c))
			 * (<= (r1 x)
			 *     (r5 x b c)
			 *     (not (r4 x b c)))
			 * How could we find this case?
			 * Only by explicitly focusing on factoring out a
			 * It's worth factoring out because it doesn't appear across all literals
			 * It's feasible to factor out because it doesn't include a not
			 * or distinct with other variables in it
			 * 
			 * But sometimes we want to look at pairs of variables, don't we?
			 * 
			 * (<= (r1 x)
			 *     (r2 x a)
			 *     (r3 x a b)
			 *     (r4 x b)
			 *     (r5 x c d))
			 * We might like to factor this into:
			 * (<= (r6 x)
			 *     (r2 x a)
			 *     (r3 x a b)
			 *     (r4 x b))
			 * (<= (r7 x)
			 *     (r5 x c d))
			 * (<= (r1 x)
			 *     (r6 x)
			 *     (r7 x))
			 * On the other hand, this might be better:
			 * (<= (r8 x b)
			 *     (r2 x a)
			 *     (r3 x a b))
			 * (<= (r6 x)
			 *     (r8 x b)
			 *     (r4 x b))
			 * Which is better? Let's assume here that r8 wouldn't be referenced
			 * by other relations for other reasons.
			 * Assume a and b each have domain size n.
			 * Then in the first case, for each (r6 const), we get:
			 * - n^2 AND gates for the n^2 possible combinations
			 * - 3n^2 inputs to the AND gates
			 * - 1 OR gate leading to (r6 const)
			 * - n^2 outputs from the AND gates to the OR gate
			 * Total: 4n^2 links
			 * In the second case, again for a given constant:
			 * - For each value of b, leading to r8:
			 *   - n AND gates, each with 2 inputs
			 *   - Outputs to an OR gate for each one
			 *   Total: 3n
			 * - Total for r8: 3n^2 links
			 * - For r6:
			 * - n AND gates, two inputs each
			 * - one OR gate
			 * - 3n links
			 * - So a total of 3n^2 + 3n; if 3 < n, this is smaller
			 * So the more "thorough" method actually appears to be better
			 * for large numbers of constants (the more typical case).
			 * 
			 * This means we really do want to factor out just one variable at a time.
			 * It just has to be useful and feasible.
			 * It is useful if there is some literal in the rule body that it
			 * doesn't appear in.
			 * It is feasible if none of the distinct or not literals that
			 * contain the variable contain other variables not fully contained
			 * in the set to be factored out.
			 * But the set to be factored out is somewhat flexible...
			 * Let's look at another example
			 * (<= (r1 x)
			 *     (r2 x a)
			 *     (r3 x b)
			 *     (not (r4 x a b))
			 *     (r5 x c)
			 *     (r6 x d)
			 *     (not (r7 x c d)))
			 * We could even entwine the two halves with something like (r5 x a c),
			 * and it would still be worth factoring.
			 * So we do want to expand to other variables in the case of not/distinct,
			 * just not in the case of positive literals.
			 * And then, of course, if it becomes useless, we ___.
			 * Maybe we can start with the nots/distincts?
			 * Though just one positive literal/one distinct doesn't seem worth factoring out.
			 * 
			 * Okay, look at it this way:
			 * We have a graph with a node for each variable not in the head
			 * Each "not" or "distinct" creates links between all variables in
			 * that literal
			 * This generates connected components that are minimal condensations
			 * as long as they are useful, which requires having at least one
			 * non-"distinct" literal including at least one of the variables
