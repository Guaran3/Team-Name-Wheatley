/**
 * ClojureConsole is a Clojure-based app that lets you interact with a Clojure
 * console that has full access to all of the Java classes in the project.
 * This allows you to quickly experiment with the classes, without having to
 * write a full-blown Java program.
 * 
 * TODO: This could use some helper scripts, to allow it to quickly load game
 *       rulesheets and so on. Right now you have to manually load everything
 *       when you want to create a state machine that's initialized to a game,
 *       which is pretty bothersome.
