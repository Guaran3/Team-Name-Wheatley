/**
 * GameCanvas_FancyGrid expands on the GameCanvas_SimpleGrid model, with
 * additional features based on situations that commonly occur when writing
 * game visualizations. These features make stronger assumptions about the
 * game being visualized, and so may not be appropriate for all games.
 * These assumptions, in addition to the GameCanvas_SimpleGrid assumptions,
 * are as follows:
 * 
 *      1) Each cell of the grid can be drawn independently,
 *         using the following layers:
 *         
 *              a) Background layer, based only on coordinates.
 *              b) Content layer, based only on game propositions.
 *              c) Foreground layer, based only on coordinates.
 *              d) Selection layer, based only on the coordinates
 *                     and the currently selected move.
 *      
 *      2) The game propositions required to render the content layer
 *         of a given cell can be determined from the current state of
 *         the game and the cell's coordinates. As a result, they will
 *         not change unless the game state changes.
 *      
 *      3) Each cell has a certain number of moves associated with it.
 *         These moves can be determined from the current state of the
 *         game and the cell's coordinates. As a result, they will not
 *         change unless the game state changes.
 *         
 *         NOTE: Multiple cells can share the same moves.
 *         
 * Given these assumptions, GameCanvas_FancyGrid handles a lot of the work
 * associated with selecting moves, rendering the grid, and caching useful
 * parts of the game state. The player will be able to select their move by
 * clicking on a cell: if there are multiple moves associated with the cell,
 * they can click on the cell multiple times to cycle through them.
 * 
 * To reflect the above assumptions, GameCanvas_FancyGrid overrides the
 * andleClickOnCell() and clearMoveSelection() methods, and instead provides
 * the following abstract methods:
 * 
 *      getFactsAboutCell(x,y)           Get all facts associated with a cell.
 *      getLegalMovesForCell(x,y)        Get all legal moves associated with a cell.
 *      
 *      renderCellBackground(g,x,y)      Draw the background for a cell.
 *      renderCellContent(g,fact)        Draw the content for a cell, given its fact.
 *      renderCellContent(g,facts)       Draw the content for a cell, given its facts.
 *      renderCellForeground(g,x,y)      Draw the foreground for a cell.
 *      
 *      renderMoveSelectionForCell(g,x,y,move)      Draw the move selection for a cell.
 * 
 * One common situation involves each cell having exactly one fact associated
 * with it, often of the form "(cell 1 1 x)". In this situation, it's more convenient
 * to have that single fact extracted and passed to renderCellContent() as a String,
 * rather than as a Set<String> containing one element. If you want that automatic
 * extraction done, override the renderCellContent() method that takes a String as its
 * second parameter. Otherwise, if your getFactsAboutCell() method is expected to return
 * multiple facts about the same cell, override the renderCellContent() method that takes
 * a Set<String> as its second parameter.
 * 
 * Another common situation involves having a game where you want to automatically
 * display the grid, drawing black boxes around grid cells and always highlighting
 * the selected grid cell with a green border. This grid visualization will be done
 * by default. If you want to disable it, override the "useGridVisualization" function
 * so that it returns false.
